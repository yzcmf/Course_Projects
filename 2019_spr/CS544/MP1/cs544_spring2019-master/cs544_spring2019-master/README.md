Repository for CS 544 course on Optimization in Computer Vision

### MP1
This MP is to compare (1) using a Quasi-Newton method that uses Conjugate Gradient to solve for the descent direction to (2) Nonlinear conjugate gradient using the Polak–Ribière conjugate direction method. To ensure the optimization routines are available, do the following within the `mp1/` directory:

```
pip install -e .
```
