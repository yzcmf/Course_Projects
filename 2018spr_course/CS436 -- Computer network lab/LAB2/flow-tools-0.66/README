flow-tools is a set of programs for processing and managing NetFlow exports
from Cisco and Juniper routers.  The software was originally written by
Mark Fullmer while working at Ohio State University.  Steve Romig and the
OSU network security group have added documentation, functionality, and
provided feedback.  OARnet and the Ohio ITEC have recently funded my
time to add version 8 PDU support and various other features.

For installation notes and a quick start please see INSTALL.
