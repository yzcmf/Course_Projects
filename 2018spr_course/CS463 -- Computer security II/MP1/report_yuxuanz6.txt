Report (40 points)

As part of this assignment you must write a one-page report in 11pt font (not including reference).
The report must explicitly answer questions in Section 1.2.3.1, Section 1.2.3.2, and Section 1.2.3.3
below. You may include additional information relevant to the evaluation of your assignment,
provided the report does not exceed one page in length.

1.2.3.1
Question 1: Dataset Analysis (10 points)
What is your answer for pb , pu1 , and pu2 in Section 1.1.2.3? Do you think it is possible to get an
inference accuracy higher than pu1 and pu2 ? Why or why not?

pb = 0.5 ; pu1 = 0.96; pu2 = 0.87; 
pu1 can't increase any more, because the unknown locations users with no friends are the minium isloated points in the graph, and we have no clues to infer them since no points connect to them.
pu2 can be increased, because even if all of their friends don't share home locations, we could use their friends of friends to infer their locations, in that case,we can infer some of their locations and pu2 increased


1.2.3.2
Question 2: Simple Inference (10 points)
What is the accuracy obtained through the Within25kmAccuracy test with your implementation of
part 1? How good is Algorithm 1? (Compare the obtained accuracy with the baseline accuracy you
calculated in Section 1.2.3.1)

The accuracy is : 0.618;
My simple inference algorithm has improved pb from 0.5 to 0.618, that means 11.8% users has been inferred their locations
which is account for 20% of the total unknown location users. It's pretty good.

1.2.3.3
Question 3: Improved Inference Algorithm (20 points)
Describe briefly the algorithm you implemented in part 2. Why do you think it will yield better
inference accuracy than Algorithm 1? In which cases do you think your algorithm will perform
well/poorly?

My improved algorithm takes use of three ideas listed. I don't implement the repeat method which uses the past inferred results.
1. First of all, I use the same way as simple algorithm to calculate geograph center point as result 1. Then we start to find the first friend of friend.
2. I find friends of friends who share home locations to the unknown location users whose friends less than 10  in order to get more datas for calculation.
3. I then find those shared locations users' points who have not great than 35km from the result 1, get rid of all the ones which is far more than 35 km.
In that case, the users data could be thorough and concentrated. Thus, the accuray could be enhanced.


My improved algorithm improve from 0.618 to 0.631. Althrough it might not be so higher, but it only repeat for one time.
Due to deadline, I don't write repeat method but it can repeat several times and the accuray could be enhanced as well.


Peformed well : 1. If the inferred method corresponed to the geograph center model and the real locations is the center point that we assume 
                2. The datasets should be large enough, and users should be all kinds of.Their freinds should be greater than 10 and smaller than 10, their locations are distributed a lot.

Peformed poor : 1. The inferred method doesn't corresponed to the center model, there is no clues to predit the real user home locations
                2. The datasets are small and concentrated in some direction as a mess
